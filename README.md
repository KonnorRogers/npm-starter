## Renaming your package

**THIS IS A DESTRUCTIVE ACTION THAT CANNOT BE UNDONE**

To rename your package, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run rename-package
```

Which will prompt you for a new name.

## Structure

`exports/` is publicly available files
`internal/` is...well...internal.

`exports` and `internal` shouldn **NOT** write their own `.d.ts` that are co-located.

`types/` is where you place your handwritten `.d.ts` files.
